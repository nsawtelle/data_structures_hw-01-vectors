# Vector10

In this assignment you will implement a somewhat contrived Vector data type for an array of size 10. This is a structure that can hold up to ten integers, but no more! 

In this assignment (and all the rest throughout the course), check out the header file (in this case, `Vector10.h`) and test file (which should always be called `test_hw.cpp`). The header gives you detailed documentation on each function that you will implement (in this case, in `Vector10.cpp`).

The test file should give you strong hints about what it expects your code to do and how it should behave. It will also give you insights about the order that you might write your functions. For example, the `TestRemove` test case also depends on you implementing the `push_back` method. That said, we recommend that you implement `value_at` and `push_back` first.
